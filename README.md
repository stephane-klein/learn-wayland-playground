# My "Learn Wayland by writing a GUI from scratch" playground

In this repository I try to follow [Learn Wayland by writing a GUI from scratch](https://gaultier.github.io/blog/wayland_from_scratch.html).

Context issue (in french): https://github.com/stephane-klein/backlog/issues/329

I try to implement this tutorial in :

- In C language: [`/c/`](./c/)
- In Zig language: [`/zig/`](./zig/)
